<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Inventorify is a project influenced by *Shopify Developer Intern Challenge*, a backend-focused challenge that allows an applicant to showcase their capabilities in an inventory management system. The idea of such a challenge is great because applicants are not limited to using a stack, or being limited to specific challenges. This is an opportunity for applicants to showcase not only their software development skills, but also their critical thinking!

The whole project is basically a collection of CRUD operations for inventory items as well as a history check for item deletion (only applicable to undeleted items).

The first version of Inventorify took me less than 6 hours of development, it was built using the MERN stack. For more information, check the `mern_stack` branch. After doing some research on Shopify, I found out that they appreciate Ruby on Rails. Hence, I made the decision of rebuilding Inventorify in Ruby on Rails with zero prior experience in this framework.
